# Jira Bot

This bot can be leveraged to automatically create Jira tickets using the Jira Server/DataCenter API.

```
Arguments:
  --token: The Jira personal access token.
  --project-key: The Jira project key where the task will be created.
  --summary: A short summary of the task.
  --description: A detailed description of the task.
  --issuetype: The type of issue to create (e.g., Task, Bug, Story).
  --epic-link: (Optional) The epic link if the task is related to a specific epic.

```

It's quite a lot of work manually!
